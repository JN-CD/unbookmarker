# Unbookmarker

Rediscover gold in your Twitter bookmarks, privately.

## Overview

Feeling overwhelmed by cluttered bookmarks? Unbookmarker helps you uncover hidden gems among your saved tweets and discard the rest. It's private by design—no servers, no API, just a simple script running right in your browser.

## How It Works

Unbookmarker operates directly within your browser. It uses JavaScript to interact with the page elements—identifying the IDs of tweet elements, clicking on them, and retrieving the tweets to display them. All this happens on your side, ensuring that there's no communication with any outside server.

## Getting Started

1. **Download Unbookmarker:** Get the extension for your Chrome browser via the webstore link or by downloading this code and running it in chrome://extensions/
2. **Discover Magic:** Navigate to your Twitter bookmarks and find the new button introduced by Unbookmarker.
3. **Enjoy:** Start rediscovering valuable content hidden in your bookmarks.

## Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. Unbookmarker functions entirely within your browser, meaning there's no data sent out. Your bookmarks remain your own, untouched and unshared.
